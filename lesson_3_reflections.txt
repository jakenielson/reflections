When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Well, I currently work on Udacity projects at home and at the office, so being able to access my repository from both locations is nice.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Maybe multiple people are working on the same repository at the same time. If Git stayed up to date automatically, it could mess with the people trying to work on the files.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is a copy of someone else's repository on GitHub. A clone is a copy of a repository on your local machine. A branch is a seperate path of commits with its own name within the same repository. You would use a fork when working on your own version of someone else's program. You would use a clone when working on your repository on a new machine or something. You would use a branch when working on a new feature in the same repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You can work on your own branch and compare with git diff, knowing that you are accessing the most recent version of the program.
